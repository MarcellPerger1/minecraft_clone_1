Play the game: 
- Website: [https://stuffwebgl4.marcellperger1.repl.co/](https://stuffwebgl4.marcellperger1.repl.co/) 
- Repl (on replit): [https://replit.com/@MarcellPerger1/stuffwebgl4#](https://replit.com/@MarcellPerger1/stuffwebgl4)

## WebAssembly
- Some of this will eventually be written in WebAssembly 
- This will improve performance **A LOT** (I hope...)
- That would allow bigger world sizes which then allows me to test/experiment with world generation on a larger scale which would mean adding trees & that stuff
- repo where I try to get WebAssembly stuff to work: [MarcellPerger1/wasm_stuff](https://github.com/MarcellPerger1/wasm_stuff)

## NOTES:
- The added current unix time after .json and .png fetches (`?t=...`) to bypass the cache as replit cache doesn't update when file is modified by a script (stupid replit)
